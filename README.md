🎯 Objective
>The goal of this project is to use Power BI to transform raw UN Volunteer data into a meaningful, interactive, and visually appealing dashboard. Key objectives include:

>Creating a Date table using DAX for time-based analysis.

>Implementing various DAX measures and calculated columns to extract key metrics.

>Designing interactive visual dashboards that reflect organizational insights, as demonstrated in the provided screenshots.

🧮 DAX Calculations

✅ 1. Date Table
A Date table is created using DAX to support time-based visuals and slicers.


✅ 2. DAX Measures
Custom DAX measures have been implemented to calculate KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).


✅ 3. Calculated Columns
Contract Duration: Calculated as the difference between the contract end date and start date.

**Gender Columns:**

Male: Set to 1 for male volunteers and 0 otherwise.

Female: Set to 1 for female volunteers and 0 otherwise.

📊 Data Visualization
>Developed multiple dashboards using a variety of colors, themes, and textures to present insights effectively.

>Dashboards mirror the layout and content seen in the attached screenshots, ensuring consistency and clarity.

>Visuals include bar charts, maps, KPIs, and slicers for enhanced interactivity.
